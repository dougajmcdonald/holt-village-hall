      <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p className="font-bold">There is parking for 50 cars.</p>
      <p>
        Parking spaces are shared between 10am-5am with the Courts (National
        Trust). Seven spaces are reserved for village hall use, but
        unfortunately we aren't able to police this.

      <h2>Cleaning</h2>
      <p className="font-bold">
        We ask that you leave the hall as you found it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hall is cleaned regularly, but as a curtesy to other hirers you are
        responsible for cleaning any mess and taking away any rubbish from your
        event. We have cleaning tools available in the cupboard opposite the
        kitchen we ask that you use.

        glasses marked with measures as are stocked in our Bar.

        There is a small charge for the use of the bar and any breakages are the

        not the guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may be able to help with contacts to provide staffing for your bar at
        an extra cost between you and them if requested. You will need to
        provide a responsible person (other than employed staff) and any stock
        to be served or sold and the removal of all bottles etc. at the end of
        the hire will be your responsibility not of those "Running the Bar" for
        you.
