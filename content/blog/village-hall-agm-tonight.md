**Covid note:**

The AGM, being a business meeting of a registered charity can go ahead, subject to what has become normal COVID practice. i.e

• It is critical that everybody observes the following key behaviours:

• HANDS - Wash your hands regularly and for 20 seconds.

• FACE - Wear a face covering in indoor settings where social distancing may be difficult, and where you will come into contact with people you do not normally meet.

• SPACE - Stay 2 metres apart from people you do not live with where possible, or 1 metre with extra precautions in place (such as wearing face coverings or increasing ventilation indoors).

• Good ventilation needs to be provided. This reduces the risk of a higher “dose” of the virus reaching people, which can cause more serious illness, in the event that someone present is carrying the virus.
