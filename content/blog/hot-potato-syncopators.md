## Hot Potato Syncopators

Straight from the golden era of the roaring twenties, these distinguished gentlemen present a musical revue of jazz and dance band melodies interspersed with visual gags, delightful humour and novelty moments.

Since 1927\* these cat-swinging jazz hounds have been delighting audiences with galloping ukulele, tea chest bass, virtuosic musical saw and charming harmony singing. Absolutely top-hole entertainment!

The band comprises of ukulele, tea-chest bass and musical saw, comedy moments, stage theatricals, acts of ear and eye defying balancing, bangs bells hooters and pop guns.

The funniest Jazziest act you'll ever see.
