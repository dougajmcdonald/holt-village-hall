**Holt Village Hall - supporting role in ‘Becoming Elizabeth’!**

‘Forge’ (a UK based independent drama company) urgently required multi-faceted facilities for use whilst filming ‘Becoming Elizabeth’ at Great Chalfield and approached Holt Village Hall in mid-March. All negotiating was carried out remotely with our booking secretaries Tim and Joy Mason. Just two days before access was required, Leon the Assistant Location Manager met our Chairperson Sue Ennis to view the hall. The entire hall was set up and used with
•	Covid checking in the car park before entry.
•	Kitchen hatch as entry/exit control point.
•	Skittle Alley Covid spaced waiting area.
•	Main Hall and stage set out with make-up stations.(all staff wearing full PPE)
•	Upper Hall set out with costumes and pictures as to how each character had to be dressed.
•	Upstairs kitchen – Girls dressing room
•	Small meeting room – Boys dressing room
•	The car park for staff only. The ‘extras’ were bussed from the Equestrian Centre and on to Great Chalfield.
Security was on site 24x7 for the entire duration. A dedicated team ensured Covid compliance and sanitising at all times (even I as Village Hall liaison in the car park had my temperature checked).
This was a first for Holt Village Hall and it was quite an experience to witness such a professional and slick operation.

NB. This was all carried out in accordance with special COVID-19 rules relating to Film and High-end TV Drama Productions.
