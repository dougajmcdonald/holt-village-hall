Following on from the very successful evening with Nick Sorensen in February and by popular request, Holt Village Hall has pleasure in hosting The New Academic Feetwarmers in the hall Friday 12th April 2024

You are promised a night of raucous New Orleans Jazz from the Frome-based 8-piece New Academic Feetwarmers

The band have been playing together since 2013 but goes way back, inspired by the music of Louis Armstrong and later in this country by Ken Collier, Chris Barber, and Acker Bilk.

Prepare for a thumping good gig with drinks at village hall prices.

12 April 2024. 7pm for 7.30 Tickets Â£10 from Holt Shop (available from 22 March) or on the door subject to availability.

Get your tickets ASAP to avoid disappointment (The Nick Sorensen evening was a sell out!)
