I am delighted to introduce myself as the new Chairperson of the Holt Village Hall Trustees. Myself and my husband have been regular visitors to Holt over the last 15 years.I have recently retired after working for 10 years as a Private Estate Manager, so we have made a permanent move to Holt to be closer to our children, both of whom work and live in the village.

Interestingly, I have recently been researching my family history and was very surprised to discover that I have links to the village dating back to the 1700s.My ancestors on my Motherâ€™s side were born in Holt and were mainly agricultural workers.My great, great, great Grandmother, Jane King married and had children before moving to London from Holt, in the late 19th Century, where the family line continued - until now!

It has been a challenging year for the Village Hall as indeed it has been for everybody.In March, lockdown forced us to cancel all bookings and close the hall which left us unable to hold our usual fundraising events. The village hall is such an important part of our community and we look forward, with anticipation, to welcoming everybody back to the hall as soon as possible.

I wish you all a very happy new year and look forward to meeting you soon.



Mrs Sue Ennis
