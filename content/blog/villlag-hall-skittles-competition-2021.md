**Holt Village Hall Skittles Competition 2021**

This year the tournament will take place in the village hall :-

Preliminary matches (3 legs) – Thursday 14th October & Friday 15th October. (If you can only make one of these dates, we can schedule for the other night.)

Quarter finals (3 legs) on Thursday 21st October.

Semi-Finals (4 legs) & Final (4 legs) on Friday 22nd October.

Earliest start will be 19.00 and the latest start will be 21.15

**Note: We have proposed Thursdays and Fridays as the main hall will be unoccupied and so provide maximum space and ventilation.**

We are limited to a maximum of 16 teams, last year all places were taken, so _to avoid disappointment please enter your team as soon as possible_.

Anyone with connection with Holt, e.g. village residence, village businesses and village organisations can enter a team, with 6 people per team. The cost is £1.50 per person per match payable on the night.

This is _primarily for fun and a comradeship_, so no previous experience is required. The rules are very simple and can be explained on the night, but basically a member from each team takes it in turn to knock down the skittles with 3 balls.

The Bar will be open serving wine, beer, cider and soft drinks at village hall prices!

For further details and to enter a team, drop me an email confirming that you wish to enter, no need for money until the night. T*he only thing we do ask is that if you enter, you must turn up otherwise the structure of the competition will fall apart.*
