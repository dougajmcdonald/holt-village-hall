**Holt Village Hall - repairs to stone plinth** 

The Trustees of Holt Village Hall have a limited skill set and often seek the advice from known experts in the village.


Having carried out repairs to the hall’s stone work over many years, we asked Paul (alias Sid) Bloomfield to keep an eye on the hall and bring to the trustees attention any areas of concern.


Last year Paul highlighted that acid created by exhaust fumes had started to erode the stone plinth supporting the main wall which runs alongside the pavement/road. Whilst not urgent at the moment it would continue to deteriorate as time goes by.


The Trustees decided that rather than delay, with the potential to forget, we would contract Paul and his brother Pete to:
•	Rake out all joints and provide a firm key with non-ferrous metal net, screws and wires.
•	Render to the original true line, with a resin based mix of Bath stone coloured mortar.
•	The resin based mix is designed to give maximum adhesion and being impervious will resist damp, thus maintaining the effectiveness of the existing damp proof course and withstand the further effects of the acid created by exhaust fumes.

Paul first worked on the Hall in the 1980s when he produced the “Holt Reading Room 1873” carved tablet which faces the road. Paul and Pete have worked on numerous prestigious projects including Salisbury and Wells Cathedrals. 

The photos show the extent of the deterioration of the stonework, work involved in cleaning up and providing a key, the finished job and the carved tablet.

The Trustees would like to welcome additional members to join them to ensure the long term future of the hall. For further information please contact:
