BIOGRAPHY

One thing that is always evident at a Carrivick Sisters performance is their joy in playing together, in singing in close harmony and in delighting an audience. Twin sisters Charlotte and Laura Carrivick have grown up playing music together, and at a live show the stage becomes an extension of their kitchen; welcoming you into a warm, musical embrace while cooking up delicious melodies and tasty instrumentals. The sisters draw inspiration from their passion for traditional American old time and bluegrass music, English folklore and the wide variety of instruments they play: guitars, mandolin, fiddle, banjo and dobro.

Performing professionally together since 2006, the Carrivicks have toured internationally, picking up fans and stories along the road and now have seven albums under their belts. Aside from playing as a duo, Laura and Charlotte have been involved in many other bands and projects through the years, most recently with the twice IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) Award nominated, Island Recording artists, Midnight Skyracer.

*“I am very impressed by The Carrivick Sisters, one of the best young*

*duos I’ve heard. The girls sing and play as one and their work is characterised by great musicality. They are not only very talented instrumentalists*

*and singers but they write really good songs as well.”* \
Ralph McTell

*“A superbly talented pair o’ lasses”*Mike Harding, BBC Radio 2

*“ …their already formidable multi-instrumental skills and songwriting maturing at such a steep curve they’ll soon be orbiting far beyond anyone else.”*Q Magazine \*\*\*\*

*”Carrivick Sisters are pick of the crop.”*The Telegraph

*“Somewhere in Kentucky, there’s a duo singing folk songs in a Devon accent.*

*It’s part of a celestial vocal exchange program, as that would be the only*

*logical reason that The Carrivick Sisters keep turning in album after*

*album of bluegrass blood harmonies to die for.”*\
FATEA Magazine

*“They are at their best singing together, but the way they play all of the bluegrass instruments is almost frightening. Their fiddle, mandolin and vocal work on their song ‘Now I know’ is almost too hot for comfort. So young, so much talent”*\
John Atkin, fRoots Nov 2011

*“Demonstrating rare instrumental and vocal superiority that puts their*

*colleagues to shame… this is one duo which is going places.”*\
Maverick Magazine \*\*\*\**

*“Is there anything these young ladies can't do?”*\
