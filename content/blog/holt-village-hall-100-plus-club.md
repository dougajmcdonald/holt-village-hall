As you will appreciate COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the running of the hall. The hall reopened on 1st September but with only about 20% of our pre-Covid regular bookings, no weekend bookings for parties etc., and no opportunity to organise the normal fundraising events, and things have been up and down ever since!

**We invited villagers to join the Holt Village Hall 100 PLUS Club to help us boost vital funds. This has been very successful, and we now have nearly 250 members, hence the new name, the 200 Plus Club. But more members are always welcome of course!**

There is an annual subscription £12 per number per year and there is a monthly draw. 50% of the income is distributed as prizes.
