As you will appreciate COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the running of the hall. The hall reopened on 1st September but with only about 20% of our pre-Covid regular bookings, no weekend bookings for parties etc., and no opportunity to organise the normal fundraising events.

**We are inviting villagers to join the Holt Village Hall 100 PLUS Club to help us boost vital funds.**

There is an annual subscription £12 per number per year and there is a monthly draw. 50% of the income is distributed as prizes.
