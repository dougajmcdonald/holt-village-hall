**Would you like to help Holt Village Hall?**

Holt Village Hall is held in a charitable trust and is managed by a committee of Trustees.

Currently we are looking for a volunteer with book keeping experience to take on the role of Treasurer.

Jo Hopkins has very efficiently held this position for very many years but now feels that it is the right time to pass that mantle onto someone new.  Jo will be remaining as a Trustee (she does very much more than look after our finances) and so will be there to assist the new incumbent as necessary.

For more information, please contact our chairman Sue Ennis **E:**[enniswhaven@aol.com](mailto:enniswhaven@aol.com)**M:** 07958 938071 or Jo Hopkins **T:**[2tjhopkins@gmail.com](mailto:2tjhopkins@gmail.com)**M:** 07940 162093

Holt Village Hall - *Registered Charity (305527)*
