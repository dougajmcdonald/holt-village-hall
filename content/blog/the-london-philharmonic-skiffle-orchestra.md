**THE LONDON PHILHARMONIC SKIFFLE ORCHESTRA** 

**is coming to Holt Village Hall on Friday April 28th at 7.30** 

Holt Village Hall has been fortunate to secure a last minute booking with The London Philharmonic Skiffle Orchestra (LPSO) before their departure for the Kihveli Soikoon Festival in Finland. 

LPSO has been highly recommended as seen locally : "a riot of colour, with innumerable changes of ridiculous sub-clown costumes throughout ... and the array of instruments is colossal ... but what impresses most is the sheer energy, skill and versatility of the musicianship – driving the show along to its faster and faster, and dafter and dafter climax. Lots of fun." John Christopher Wood (Rondo Theatre, Bath Comedy Festival)

In addition to Britain, they have wowed festival audiences in Finland, Norway, Belgium, Denmark and Germany.

Their individual experiences range from appearances on the Benny Hill Show, Kenny Everett Show, Eastenders, Little & Large Show and StarWars to performing in Barnums Circus (USA).

We expect tickets to sell out very quickly, so get your tickets now from Holt Super Store for £10 (cash only please).

Bar will be open with wine and beer (at village hall prices)
