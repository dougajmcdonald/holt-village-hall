**Holt Village Hall – repairs and maintenance**

Most villagers will be oblivious to the continuous repairs and maintenance which goes into the upkeep of Holt Village Hall.

In recent weeks the hall has:

· completed finishing touches to the downstairs toilets following the new flooring fitted last year.

· replaced the decaying door at the back of the boiler room (facing the road) with uPVC fitted panel.

· completed a makeover to the upstairs kitchen including new worktops. (decorating to follow)

In April you will see scaffolding going up between the village hall and the side of Holt Superstore to enable new roofing to be fitted above the skittle Alley. See next month’s post for more details and photos.

These projects have been funded by:

· villagers hiring the hall.

· villagers supporting events organised in the hall.

· the National Trust donation for allowing visitor to park in the hall car park.

So thank you for your continued support.
