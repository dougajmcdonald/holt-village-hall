The 38th Holt Flower and Produce Show in aid of Holt Village Hall funds will be held on Saturday 4th September in the Village Hall, and will include many entry classes such as Vegetables, Cakes and Cookery, Arts and Crafts, and of course, Flowers. All are welcome to take part, and there are classes for children as well as adults. We like to keep this a friendly event, of course, with just a little hint of rivalry.

Details of this event including recipes can be found in the Schedule and Entry Form booklet which is available now at Holt Store free of charge.

For further information please contact Jo on 01225 782665 or 07940 162093

If you're not going to enter, come along on the day anyway and see what amazing things the talented people of Holt can achieve and enjoy the thrill of the contest!
