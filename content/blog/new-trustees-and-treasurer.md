**Would you like to help Holt Village Hall?**

Holt Village Hall is held in a charitable trust and managed by a committee â€“ **the Trustees**.

The trustees are indebted to many others in the village for both practical and financial support.

Currently we are looking for additional volunteers to become Trustees, ***in particular someone with book keeping experience*** to take on the role of treasurer from Jo Hopkins who has been our very efficient Treasurer for very very many years but now feels that it is the right time to pass that mantle onto someone new.  

Jo will be remaining as a Trustee (she does very much more than look after our finances) and so will be there to assist the new incumbent as necessary.

For more information, please contact our chairman Sue Ennis **E:**[enniswhaven@aol.com](mailto:enniswhaven@aol.com)**M:** 07958 938071 or Jo Hopkins **T:**[2tjhopkins@gmail.com](mailto:2tjhopkins@gmail.com)**M:** 07940 162093
