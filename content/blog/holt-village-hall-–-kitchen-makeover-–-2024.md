**HOLT VILLAGE HALL – KITCHEN MAKEOVER – 2024**

Over the summer the Village Hall has completed a kitchen makeover and extended the long life of the existing facilities.

The work included:

Repairing and strengthening the existing floor cupboards

Removing the existing floor covering and replacing with new including under the main existing floor cupboards to facilitate more thorough cleaning

Providing in situ rollers to enable the moveable floor units to be more easily moved for floor cleaning

Replacing the kickboards

Modifying pipework to allow the dishwasher to be fully recessed

Replacing the existing worn worktops with decorative granite worktops

General deep cleaning and repainting

The Trustees are most grateful to fellow Trustees and friends of Holt Village Hall for doing this work, and to David Ayres Flooring and P M Bines Ltd for their installations and attention to detail.
