**Holt Village Hall Skittles Tournament 2024**

Over 90 people took part in the 2024 annual skittles tournament which was held over 4 evenings.

This is a knockout competition which always has some surprising results:

**The ultimate** **winners, Holt FC** were only the third highest score in the first round

The Softies who had the highest score in the first round were knocked out in the second round.

Three of the four teams which reached the semi-finals scored less at the same stage than they did in the first or secondrounds

The runners up in the final didn’t make it pass the first round last year.

From the above, past performance is not a guide to future performance, so we look forward to seeing you all next year.

I consider that Skittles are a mixture of skill and luck, which was demonstrated in the finals where one player with three balls scored: 0, 9 and 0 I can’t decide if the 9 was good luck or the zeros were bad luck!
