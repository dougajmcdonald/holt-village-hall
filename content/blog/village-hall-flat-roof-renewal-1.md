**Holt Village Hall Flat Roof Renewal**

You may have seen scaffolding on the side of the hall running parallel to the shop. This was to enable the felt based membrane over the Skittle Alley, Bar and Kitchen area to be replaced. Over recent years it had become problematic!

The work involved: 

•	removing the redundant roof lights which had been capped when a suspended ceiling was installed.

 •	fitting ”furring strips” to the existing deck to provide a 6 degree slope to ensure water runs rapidly away from the building 
•	fitting 18mm sterling board over the entire area.
•	Laying an EPDM membrane with drip trims and new sealing to the stonework. 

EPDM is an extremely durable synthetic rubber membrane which isn't damaged by the sun's ultraviolet rays and is incredibly long-lasting.

The Village Hall Committee (Trustees) had anticipated for some time that this work would become inevitable and had accordingly built up £20k funds to pay for it.

The Trustees would like to welcome additional members to join them to ensure the long term future of the hall. Please contact the Secretary for further information.
