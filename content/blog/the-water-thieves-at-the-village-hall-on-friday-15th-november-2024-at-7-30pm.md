Good News! The Water Thieves gig at Holt Village Hall on the 18th October which unfortunately had to be postponed has now been rescheduled for Friday 15th November at 7:30pm! If you've already bought your tickets, come along, but if you can't make that date, refunds can be obtained at the Village Shop.

If you haven't got your tickets yet, be quick!

With numbers from the1920s to The Wire and Tom Waits, prepare to be entertained, sing along, heckle and dance to the Water Thieves â€“ a jazzy, swingy sound with a hint of skiffle and more than a hint of chaos.

A bag full of instruments accompanies edgy three-part harmonies. Sarah has polished her triangle, Sophy has warmed up her hooters and sharpened her saw.

Simon is still wondering how he got mixed up in all this.

Maracas, guitar and clarinet are ready to roll, bubble mixture mixed and honey and lemon gargled. What could possibly go wrong?

Come and find out for yourself on the 15th of November!
