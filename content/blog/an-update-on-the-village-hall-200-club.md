**Holt Village Hall 200 + Club**

As 2021 draws to a close it is appropriate to provide an update on Holt Village Hall monthly draw. This was traditionally The Holt Village Hall 100 Club, but at the beginning of 2021 the Trustees decided that it was a good time to open up and expand it to 200. Well demand was such that we decided when we got to 243 active numbers to close membership for 2021.

To cater for the larger quantity of numbers this year we ditched the bucket and numbered disk and moved to an electronic random number generator.

All numbers now run to a common renewal date of January 2022 (after the January draw) Renewal notices will be sent to all existing members.

So thank you to everyone who has supported this scheme and as a result the Hall has received £1,383 in this calendar year. An equal amount has been returned in prizes.  See below for a list of this years lucky winners.

*If you are not a member and* would like to support the hall in this way next year please drop Rob Page an email [pageholt@btinternet.com](mailto:pageholt@btinternet.com)
