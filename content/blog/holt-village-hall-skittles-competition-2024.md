**Holt Village Hall Skittles Competition 2024**

This year the tournament will take place in the village hall:-

Preliminary matches (3 legs) – Wednesday 16th and Wednesday 23rd October. (If you can only make one of these dates, we can schedule for the other night.)

Quarter finals (3 legs) on Wednesday 30th October.

Semi-Finals (4 legs) & Final (4 legs) on Friday 1st November

Earliest start will be 19.00 and the latest start will be 21.15 (If you need an early or late start time just let us know)

We are limited to a maximum of 16 teams, the last few years all places have been taken, so*to avoid disappointment please enter your team as soon as possible*.

Anyone with connection with Holt, e.g. village residence, village businesses and village organisations can enter a team, with 6 people per team. The cost is £2.00 per person per match payable on the night.

This is *primarily for fun and a comradeship*, so no previous experience is required. The rules are very simple and can be explained on the night, but basically a member from each team takes it in turn to knock down the skittles with 3 balls.

The Bar will be open serving wine, beer, cider and soft drinks at village hall prices!

For further details and to enter a team, drop me an email confirming that you wish to enter, no need for money until the night, *the only thing we do ask is that if you enter, you must turn up otherwise the structure of the competition will fall apart.*
